# Phylax Systems

Phylax is an open-source security protocol for securing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchain networks, by actively censoring hacks on the underlying network. We want to restore the credibility of our industry, enabling institutions and individuals to deploy capital with confidence.

We are building both an off-chain component in Rust and on-chain mechanism that ensures that the censorship is according to the rules set by every dapp.

We build in public and we are comitted to building free and open source software (FOSS).
