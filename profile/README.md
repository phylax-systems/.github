At Phylax Systems, we want to restore the credibility of our industry, enabling institutions and individuals to deploy capital confidently.

We are currently building two products:
- A next-gen monitoring agent, we call Phylax, that enables developers to monitor their Dapp on any EVM chain using the affordances and tools they already know. It's the easiest way for engineers and teams to observe the live state of their dapp and instrument incident response. We are building the "Prometheus and Grafana" stack of web3.
- A security protocol that enables Dapps to prevent hacks by censoring malicious transactions at the infrastructure level. We call it "Dapp-defined censorship". This is a fresh approach to one of the most crucial issues in our industry.

We build in public and are committed to building free and open-source software (FOSS). We also seek ambitious and talented engineers to join the Founding team.

It's about time we put North Korea out of Business.
